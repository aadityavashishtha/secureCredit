                      A personal loan is purely unsecured, short term cash loan, which means that the individual customer is not required to provide the bank with any security (ex. property, jewels) or any kind of guaranty against the personal loan.
                      <br><br>
                      Formally, for any urgent cash requirement, we prefer personal loan. It can be taken for any general purposes like education, reconstruction of property/home renovation, a wedding expense, vacation etc. Most of the finance companies or other banks offer Personal Loan up to Rs. 40 lacs for salaried customers. Normally, it can be repaid over a period of 12 months to 60 months.
                      <br><br>
                      The personal loan amount you are eligible for and the personal loan interest rate for you will depend on factors such as monthly income, customers employment history, residence history and past financial credit history along with the pattern. Banks typically have capped the monthly payment (EMI) on your loan to about approximately 60% – 70% of your monthly take home income. However, a customer cannot take a personal loan for any kind of bad investment or expense which is not approved by the banks or by the law.

                      Mortgage loan is a type of secured loan that you can avail by keeping an immovable asset as mortgage with the lender. The asset can be a residential/commercial property or other immovable properties like heavy machinery.
                      <br><br>
                      This type of loan is secured on the borrower's property as per process which is called mortgage origination. Such loans are long-term advances with repayment tenors ranging from 15 – 20 years and interest rates much lower compared to unsecured advances. You can utilise the loan amount to meet diverse funding needs involving big-ticket expenditures.
                      <br><br>

                      <br><br>

                      <h4>Difference between a Mortgage and a Reverse Mortgage?</h4>
                      Difference between a mortgage and a reverse mortgage loan are as follows –
                      <br><br>
                      A mortgage loan provides finances against the mortgage of an immovable asset. A reverse mortgage loan provides funds against a residential property’s equity build-up.
                      <br><br>
                      The regular mortgage loan can be availed by mortgaging either a residential or a commercial property or machinery. But only a residential property, where the borrower resides, can be used for reverse mortgaging.
                      <br><br>
                      Mortgage loans can be availed by all types of borrowers. Reverse mortgages are only meant for senior citizens.
                      <br><br>
                      Mortgage loans are repayable over a decided tenor. But under reverse mortgages, no repayment is required until the demise of the borrower or nominee.
                      <br><br>
                      Repayment liability under mortgage loans includes the principal plus interest. Under reverse mortgages, repayment liabilities can never exceed the reverse mortgaged property’s value.
                      <br><br>

                        Moving outstanding debt on one credit card to another card—usually a new one—is a balance transfer. Credit card balance transfers are typically used by consumers who want to move the amount they owe to a credit card with a significantly lower promotional interest rate and better benefits, such as a rewards program to earn cash back or points for everyday spending.

                      <h5>What is a Top Up Loan ?</h5>
                      A top-up loan is the loan one takes over and above an already existing loan. The existing loan could either be a home loan, a personal loan, or any other form of loan. Timely payments on the existing loan favor your chances of getting a top-up loan.
                      <br><br>
                      It is an add-on facility offered by lenders to their existing customer of all kind of loans like Personal loans, Business loans ,Home loans,
                      Loan against property.
                      <br><br>
                      <h5>Under this programme, Bank identifies following points</h5>
                      No EMI is Due <br>
                      No cheque bounces or EMI bounces <br>
                      Cibil of the customer to check whether he has taken more loans <br>
                      Job stability etc <br>
                      Apply For Personal Loan <br><br>
                      If all of the above are okay with the bank they give Top up loan to the customer in max 2 days.
                      <br><br>
                      The rate of interest is either same of lower by 1%.
                      <br><br>
                      So if a customer already has a Personal Loan and he needs another loan, he should check with the existing bank rather than the new bank as this loan will have less hassles rather than getting a new Personal loan.
                      <br><br>
                      But if other Banks are giving personal loan at lower rate, then he should opt for a new bank.
